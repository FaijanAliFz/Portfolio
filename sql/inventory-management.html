        <p>
          This project involves a comprehensive analysis of customer orders and
          product sales within an e-commerce database. It leverages SQL queries
          to extract valuable insights that can guide business decision-making
          in areas such as customer retention, product performance, and revenue
          generation. The queries focus on understanding various aspects of
          business performance, including customer spending, order frequency,
          product sales, and regional trends. Insights gained from the data
          analysis can inform marketing strategies, inventory management, and
          overall business operations. The results provide a detailed view of
          which customers are driving the most revenue, which products are
          performing the best, and how orders are distributed across different
          time periods and locations. By analyzing customer behaviors, product
          sales, and transaction patterns, this project helps to uncover trends
          that can be used to optimize sales strategies, improve customer
          engagement, and streamline operations. The goal is to transform raw
          data into actionable insights that support business growth and enhance
          customer satisfaction.
