<br><br>In the realm of <b>Python for Data Analysis</b>, I leverage libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn to build robust analytical tools and predictive models, tackling projects ranging from COVID-19 trend analysis to customer churn predictions. With <b>Python for Data Visualization</b>, I utilize Plotly, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to build interactive dashboards that simplify complex datasets, enabling effective storytelling and insights. I am proficient in <b>BigQuery</b>, where I analyze large-scale datasets, processing customer behavior, e-commerce trends, and public datasets efficiently with SQL. Lastly, my expertise in <b>R</b> includes statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization, providing solutions for projects like real estate price predictions and social media sentiment analysis.
